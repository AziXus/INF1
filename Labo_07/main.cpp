 Purpose    : The user is asked to enter the number of players, the number of series per players
              and the number of shots. The program then generate random shots (points on a
              200x200 grid) and calculate the distance from the center of the target to
              the shot. The score is 100 points minus the distance. A message is displayed
              if a best score is reached.

 Comment(s) : The number of players must be between 2 and 10, the number of series between
              1 and 10 and the number of shots between 6 and 12. The target is a circle of
              100 of radius.

 Compiler   : g++ 6.5.0
